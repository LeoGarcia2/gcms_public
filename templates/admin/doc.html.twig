		<h2>Things to know</h2>

		<p>GCMS is a Symfony 4 installation with some GUI for content managers and developers, so if you can do something with Symfony, you can do it with GCMS by codding directly within the source. It also means that you can extend/modify the behavior of the backoffice by yourself.</p>
